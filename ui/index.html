            <h2>About LinkedFootball</h2>
            <p> Football is the most-watched sport in the world, which connects billions of fans
                worldwide. It has been played since the 19th century, which makes it a huge
                resource of information, from leagues and competitions to players. As the sport
                keeps evolving, as well as technology, their interaction is being widely explored
                nowadays, which creates the need for structured football-related knowledge.<br /><br />
                This project, named LinkedFootball, aims to mitigate this need, by building a
                comprehensive knowledge base about football. By taking advantage of the content
                learned with the “WSDL” course, we seek to organize and present football data in a
                structured way, by leveraging semantic web technologies and linked data principles.
                Our goal is to have a knowledge base that establishes meaningful relationships
                between all the entities of soccer, from teams and players to competitions and titles,
                providing a rich and complete resource for fans and researchers in a structured and
                accessible way.</p>
